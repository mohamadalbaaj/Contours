## Draw contours around any shape

-  Using this code you can create contours around shapes of any color but the green ones since we use the number representing the green color around the shapes.
-  The first argument represents the number of contours, the second argument for the color, and the last one for the thickness  **-1, (0, 255, 0), 3**  
- For the original image, in order to adjust the code to suit your purposes you have to change the numbers in line **11**, for example, **(-1)** will draw for you all the contours, and **(0)** will draw for you the first contours and so on.
-  For the grey image, you have to adjust the code in the line **12**
